The experiments have been carried out as per VTU requirements.
Used gpdk180 for simulation
There are two folders:
    o Analog - Part A Analog experiments
    o Digital - Part B Digital experiments

Analog
 1. Inverter 
    o Has two schematics: Inverter and Inverter_tb
    o Tb simulation states have been saved within the cell view
    o Parametric contains the simulation specifications for trying wn=wp,wp/2,2wp
    o As per simulation,wn=1u and wp=3.5u gives best ratioed inverter.

 2.NAND gate will be simulated with wn/wp=1/4 um
